## Fabic Data Factory LAB

### Step by step Lab:
- Create a new Data Pipeline from the Workspace upper menu
- Add a new Data Flow activity to the pipeline
- Add a new Data `Source` to the Data Flow
- Add a new Data `Destination` to the Data Flow
- Experiment with all the options on the Source and Destination
- Validate the pipeline
- Run the pipeline
- While running the pipeline, check the `Monitor` tab to see the progress of the pipeline (it will finish within 25 seconds as the file might be too small, so hurry up)
- Experiment with the `Schedule`, `Trigger`, the option of including a Data Flow in a Pipeline, and the option of including a Pipeline in a Pipeline.
